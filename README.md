This patient has three serious illnesses. Because of what he suffers.<br>
The first disease is cancer.<br>
The operation was performed more than 2 years ago. Removed two malignant tumors. But they can arise again at any time.<br>
The second and third are neurological diseases and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.<br>
Detected in January 2021.<br>
Current state.<br>
He can move, but badly. He has frequent dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, poor hearing. There were times when he fell right on the street. There is no way to go straight. As if someone is constantly pushing him to the sides. Constant fear of being hit by a car. Therefore, he spends most of his time at home.<br>
Almost his only opportunity is to go to the store for food. And this is the little that he can buy a little.<br>
Can't work.<br>
Any help you could send would be very great.<br>
The $ 10 you sent, maybe $ 50 or more, will be very valuable help.
